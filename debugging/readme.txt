The python interpreter goes through 2 phases:
1. Parsing Phase(detect syntax error)
2. Interpretation Phase(detect logical error)
Errors that are not syntax error are called Exceptions,
because they happen during the Interpretation Phase.

Parses just check for error in the linear manner
but interpreter follows more logical manner of 
checking errors(i.e. following the instructions).
